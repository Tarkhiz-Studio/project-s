# What is "Project S"?

Project S is a new game style space shooter that i'm testing on the HTML5 Canvas resource and pure JavaScript, with a little bit of CSS. This project will not be a official game and we're just testing some specs we can use in future. already answering... of course i'll leave this open-source.
